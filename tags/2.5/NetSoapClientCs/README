soap-sec v. 2.5.
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Converted the project to Visual Studio Express 2010

2. Added check box for enabling HTTP header 'SoapAction',
   which is required by Axis2 server (apparently putting
   it to SOAP Header is not enough for this server).

3. Added a button for Wsdl/Xsd browsing

4. Improved UI layout a bit. 

5. Created SVN tag 2.5. Take source from there if you need it.
   I will not create src zips anymore

IMPORTANT NOTICE: If UI controls are trimmed, simply increase 
the size of main window. It should be OK next time when you start 
it.

soap-sec v. 2.3.
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. .NET SOAP Header suppression added. It improves interop with 
   Axis services where Timestamp header is not supported by default.

   Suppress SOAP Headers)
